# Find more information on toml format here:  https://github.com/toml-lang/toml
# The name of the mod loader type to load - for regular FML @Mod mods it should be javafml

# A version range to match for said mod loader - for regular FML @Mod it will be the forge version
loaderVersion="[44,)" #mandatory This is typically bumped every Minecraft version by Forge. See our download page for lists of versions.
# The license for you mod. This is mandatory metadata and allows for easier comprehension of your redistributive properties.
# Review your options at https://choosealicense.com/. All rights reserved is the default copyright stance, and is thus the default here.
license="MIT License"
# A URL to refer people to when problems occur with this mod
#issueTrackerURL="https://change.me.to.your.issue.tracker.example.invalid/" #optional
# A list of mods - how many allowed here is determined by the individual mod loader
[[mods]] #mandatory
# The modid of the mod
modId="swisstraditions" #mandatory
# The version number of the mod - there's a few well known ${} variables useable here or just hardcode it
# ${file.jarVersion} will substitute the value of the Implementation-Version as read from the mod's JAR file metadata
# see the associated build.gradle script for how to populate this completely automatically during a build
version="0.0.1-1.19.3" #mandatory
 # A display name for the mod
displayName="SwissTraditions" #mandatory

# A text field displayed in the mod UI
authors="valentinbaumann01" #optional
# Display Test controls the display for your mod in the server connection screen
# MATCH_VERSION means that your mod will cause a red X if the versions on client and server differ. This is the default behaviour and should be what you choose if you have server and client elements to your mod.
# IGNORE_SERVER_VERSION means that your mod will not cause a red X if it's present on the server but not on the client. This is what you should use if you're a server only mod.
# IGNORE_ALL_VERSION means that your mod will not cause a red X if it's present on the client or the server. This is a special case and should only be used if your mod has no server component.
# NONE means that no display test is set on your mod. You need to do this yourself, see IExtensionPoint.DisplayTest for more information. You can define any scheme you wish with this value.
# IMPORTANT NOTE: this is NOT an instruction as to which environments (CLIENT or DEDICATED SERVER) your mod loads on. Your mod should load (and maybe do nothing!) whereever it finds itself.
#displayTest="MATCH_VERSION" # MATCH_VERSION is the default if nothing is specified (#optional)

# The description text for the mod (multi line!) (#mandatory)
description='''
I was only 9 years old.
I loved Shrek so much, I had all the merchandise and movies.
I pray to Shrek every night, thanking him for the life I’ve been given. “Shrek is love” I say, “Shrek is life."
My dad hears me and calls me a faggot. I knew he was just jealous of my devotion to Shrek.
I called him a cunt.
He hits me and sends me to sleep.
I'm crying now and my face hurts.
I lay in bed, really cold. I feel something warm...
It's Shrek! I was so happy.
He whispers in my ear "This is my swamp."
He grabs me with his ogre hands, and puts me on my hands and knees. I'm ready.
I spread my ass cheeks for Shrek.
He penetrates my butthole.
It hurts so much, but I do it for Shrek. I can feel my butt tearing and eyes watering.
I want to please Shrek.
He roars a mighty roar as he fills my butt with his love.
My dad walks in.
Shrek looks him straight in the eye and says,
"It's all ogre now."
Shrek leaves through my window.
Shrek is love. Shrek is life.
